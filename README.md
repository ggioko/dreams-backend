# COMP1531 Major Project

## Change Log

 * 22/02: Please note, while `channel_leave`, `channel_addowner`, `channel_removeowner` are included in `channel.py` during iteration 1, you are **not** required to implement these as part of iteration 1 (they are also not included in the interface table until iteration 2).

## 2. Overview

To manage the transition from trimesters to hexamesters in 2020, UNSW has established a new focus on building an in-house digital collaboration and communication tool for groups and teams to support the high intensity learning environment.

Rather than re-invent the wheel, UNSW has decided that it finds the functionality of **<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software">Microsoft Teams</a>** to be nearly exactly what it needs. For this reason, UNSW has contracted out Penguin Pty Ltd (a small software business run by Hayden) to build the new product. In UNSW's attempt to try and add a lighter not to the generally fatigued and cynical student body, they have named their UNSW-based product **UNSW Dreams** (or just **Dreams** for short). **UNSW Dreams** is the communication tool that allows you to share, communication, and collaborate to (attempt to) make dreams a reality.

Penguin Pty Ltd has sub-contracted two software firms:

* BlueBottle Pty Ltd (two software developers, Andrea and Andrew, who will build the initial web-based GUI)
* YourTeam Pty Ltd (a team of talented misfits completing COMP1531 in 21T1), who will build the backend python server and possibly assist in the GUI later in the project

In summary, UNSW contracts Penguin Pty Ltd, who sub contracts:

* BlueBottle (Andrea and Andrew) for front end work
* YourTeam (you and others) for backend work

Penguin Pty Ltd met with Andrea and Andrew (the front end development team) 2 weeks ago to brief them on this project. While you are still trying to get up to speed on the requirements of this project, Andrea and Andrew understand the requirements of the project very well.

Because of this they have already specified a **common interface** for the frontend and backend to operate on. This allows both parties to go off and do their own development and testing under the assumption that both parties will comply with the common interface. This is the interface **you are required to use**

Besides the information available in the interface that Andrea and Andrew provided, you have been told (so far) that the features of **Dreams** that UNSW would like to see implemented include:

1. Ability to login, register if not registered, and log out
2. Ability to reset password if forgotten
3. Ability to see a list of channels
4. Ability to create a channel, join a channel, invite someone else to a channel, and leave a channel
5. Within a channel, ability to view all messages, view the members of the channel, and the details of the channel
6. Within a channel, ability to send a message now, or to send a message at a specified time in the future
7. Within a channel, ability to edit, share between channels, remove, pin, unpin, react, or unreact to a message
8. Ability to view anyone's user profile, and modify a user's own profile (name, email, handle, and profile photo)
9. Ability to search for messages based on a search string
10. Ability to modify a user's admin permissions: (MEMBER, OWNER)
11. Ability to begin a "standup", which is an X minute period where users can send messages that at the end of the period will automatically be collated and summarised to all users
12. Ability to send message directly to a user (or group of users) via direct messaging (DM).

The specific capabilities that need to be built for this project are described in the interface at the bottom. This is clearly a lot of features, but not all of them are to be implemented at once (see below)

## 3. Iteration 1: Basic functionality and tests

### 3.1. Task

In this iteration, you are expected to:

1. Write tests for and implement the basic functionality of Dreams. The basic functionality is defined as the `auth_*`, `channel_*`, `channels_*` capabilities/functions, as per the interface section below.

    * Test files you add should all be in the form `*_test.py`.

2. Write down any assumptions that you feel you are making in your interpretation of the specification.

    *  The marking will be heavily biased toward how well you follow good practices and work together as a team. Just having a "working" solution at the end is not, on its own, sufficient to even get a passing mark.

    * The `assumptions.md` file described above should be in the root of your repository. If you've not written markdown before (which we assume most of you haven't), it's not necessary to research the format. Markdown is essentially plain text with a few extra features for basic formatting. You can just stick with plain text if you find that easier.

    * Do NOT attempt to try and write or start a web server. Don't overthink how these functions are meant to connect to a frontend yet. That is for the next iteration. In this iteration you are just focusing on the basic backend functionality.

3. Follow best practices for git, project management, and effective teamwork, as discussed in lectures.

    * You need to use the **GitLab Taskboard** for your task tracking and allocation. Don't do it in a google doc or some other method - your tutor will not award marks for this. Spend some time getting to know how to use the taskboard.

    * For this iteration you and will need to collectively make a minimum of **12** merge requests into `master`.

### 3.2. Implementing and testing features

You should first approach this project by considering its distinct "features". Each feature should add some meaningful functionality to the project, but still be as small as possible. You should aim to size features as the smallest amount of functionality that adds value without making the project more unstable. For each feature you should:

1. Create a new branch.
2. Write tests for that feature and commit them to the branch.
3. Implement that feature.
4. Make any changes to the tests such that they pass with the given implementation. You should not have to do a lot here. If you find that you are, you're not spending enough time on step 2.
5. Consider any assumptions you made in the previous steps and add them to `assumptions.md`.
6. Create a merge request for the branch.
7. Get someone in your team who **did not** work on the feature to review the merge request.
8. Fix any issues identified in the review.
9. Merge the merge request into master.

For this project, a feature is typically sized somewhere between a single function, and a whole file of functions (e.g. `auth.py`). It is up to you and your team to decide what each feature is.

There is no requirement that each feature be implemented by only one person. In fact, we encourage you to work together closely on features, especially to help those who may still be coming to grips with python.

Please pay careful attention to the following:

* We want to see **evidence that you wrote your tests before writing the implementation**. As noted above, the commits containing your initial tests should appear *before* your implementation for every feature branch. If we don't see this evidence, we will assume you did not write your tests first and your mark will be reduced.
* Merging in merge requests with failing pipelines is **very bad practice**. Not only does this interfere with your teams ability to work on different features at the same time, and thus slow down development, it is something you will be penalised for in marking.
* Similarly, merging in branches with untested features is also **very bad practice**. We will assume, and you should too, that any code without tests does not work.
* Pushing directly to `master` is not possible for this repo. The only way to get code into master is via a merge request. If you discover you have a bug in `master` that got through testing, create a bugfix branch and merge that in via a merge request.

### 3.3. File Structure and stub code

The tests you write should be as small and independent as possible. This makes it easier to identify why a particular test may be failing. Similarly, try to make it clear what each test is testing for. Meaningful test names and documentation help with this. An example of how to structure tests has been done in:

* `/src/echo.py`
* `/tests/echo_test.py`

The echo functionality is tested, both for correct behaviour and for failing behaviour. As echo is relatively simple functionality, only 2 tests are required. For the larger features, you will need many tests to account for many different behaviours.

Be sure to turn your `src` and `tests` directories into Python packages. This can be done by creating two files:
  * `src/__init__.py`
  * `tests/__init__.py`

As packages you will be able to import Python code from a directory with the same syntax as you would a module. More information can be found <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/modules.html#packages"> here.</a>

A number of files have been added to your `/src/` folder in your repository. These files are:
 * `auth.py`
 * `channel.py`
 * `channels.py`
 * `user.py` (not *required* for iteration 1)
 * `message.py` (not *required* for iteration 1)
 * `other.py` (all except `clear` are not *required* for iteration 1)

They do not contain any real implementation, but do contain some stub code to give you a feel for what the different functions should return. You will replace these stubs with actual implementations as you develop.

#### 3.3.1. `auth.py`

Elements of securely storing passwords and other tricky authorisation methods are not required for iteration 1. You can simply store passwords plainly, and the user ID is used to identify them. We will discuss ways to improve the quality and methods of these capabilities in iteration 2.

#### 3.3.2 Test writing guidelines

To test basic functionality you will likely need code like:

```python
result = auth.auth_register('validemail@gmail.com', '123abc!@#', 'Hayden', 'Everest')
auth.auth_login('validemail@gmail.com', '123abc!@#') # Expect to work since we registered
```

and

```python
result = auth.auth_register('validemail@gmail.com', '123abc!@#', 'Hayden', 'Everest')
with pytest.raises(InputError) as e:
    auth.auth_login('didntusethis@gmail.com', '123abcd!@#') # Expect fail since never registered
```

However, when deciding how to structure your tests, keep in mind the following:

* Your tests should be *black box* unit tests.
  * Black box means they should not depend your implementation, but rather *any* working implementation. You should design your tests such that if they were run against another group's backend they would still pass
  * Unit tests mean the tests focus on testing particular functions, rather than the system as a whole. Certain unit tests will depend on other tests succeeding. It's OK to write tests that are only a valid test if other functions are correct (e.g. to test `channel` functions you can assume that `auth` is implemented correctly).
* Avoid writing your tests such that they need to be run in a particular order. That can make it hard to identify what exactly is failing.
* Consider resetting the state of the application (e.g. deleting all users, channels, messages, etc.) at the start of every test. That way you know none of them are accidentally dependent on an earlier test. You can add an extra function for this that is run at the beginning of each test.
* If you find yourself needing similar code at the start of a series of tests, consider using a fixture to avoid repetition.

### 3.3.3 Valid email format

A valid email should match the following regular expression:

```
'^[a-zA-Z0-9]+[\\._]?[a-zA-Z0-9]+[@]\\w+[.]\\w{2,3}$'
```

The python `re` (regular expression) module allows you to determine whether a string matches a regular expression. You do not need to understand regular expressions to effectively utilise the `re` module to check if the email is correct.

### 3.4. Storing data

Nearly all of the functions will likely have to reference some "data source" to store information. E.G. If you register two users, create two channels, and then add a user to a channel, all of that information needs to be "stored" somewhere. The most important thing for iteration 1 is not to overthink this problem.

Firstly, you do **not have to use an SQL database, or something like firebase**.

Secondly, you don't need to make anything persist. What that means is that if you run all your pytests, and then run them again later, the data is OK to be "fresh" every time you run `pytest`. We will cover persistence in another iteration.

Our recommended approach is simply using a global variable, or series of global variables, and having your functions use and import them. For example, you could define a structure in a file that is empty, and as functions are called it populates and fills up like the one below:

```python
data = {
    'users': [
        {
            'id': 1,
            'name' : 'user1',
        },
        {
            'id': 2,
            'name' : 'user2',
        },
    ],
    'channels': [
        {
            'id': 1,
            'name' : 'channel1',
        },
        {
            'id': 2,
            'name' : 'channel2',
        },
    ],
}
```

### 3.5. Bad Assumptions

Here are a few examples of bad assumptions:

* Assume that all groups store their data in a field called data which is located in auth.py
* Assume all individual return values are returned as single values rather than being stored in a dictionary
* Assume the functions are written correctly
* Assume the input token is valid

Bad assumptions are usually ones that directly contradict an explicit or implicit requirement in the specification. Good assumptions are ones that fill holes in gaps of requirements.

### 3.6. Working in parallel

Iteration provides challenges for many groups when it comes to working in parallel. Your group's initial reaction will be that you need to complete registration before you can complete login, and then login must be done before channel creation, etc.

The most appropriate approach is to have people working on down-stream tasks (like the channels implementation) work with _stubbed_ versions of the up-stream tasks. E.G. The login function is stubbed to return a successful dummy response, and therefore two people can work in parallel:

### 6.3. Errors for all functions

Either an `InputError` or `AccessError` is thrown when something goes wrong. All of these cases are listed in the **Interface** table.

One exception is that, even though it's not listed in the table, for all functions except `auth/register`, `auth/login`, `auth/passwordreset/request` (iteration 3) and `auth/passwordreset/reset` (iteration 3), an `AccessError` is thrown when the auth_user_id passed in is not a valid id.

### 6.4. Pagination

The behaviour in which channel_messages returns data is called **pagination**. It's a commonly used method when it comes to getting theoretially unbounded amounts of data from a server to display on a page in chunks. Most of the timelines you know and love - Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn - do this.

For example, if we imagine a user with token "12345" is trying to read messages from channel with ID 6, and this channel has 124 messages in it, 3 calls from the client to the server would be made. These calls, and their corresponding return values would be:
 * channel_messages("12345", 6, 0) => { [messages], 0, 50 }
 * channel_messages("12345", 6, 50) => { [messages], 50, 100 }
 * channel_messages("12345", 6, 100) => { [messages], 100, -1 }

### 6.5. Permissions
 * Members in a channel have one of two channel permissions.
   1) Owner of the channel (the person who created it, and whoever else that creator adds)
   2) Members of the channel
 * Dreams users have two global permissions
   1) Owners (permission id 1), who can also modify other owners' permissions.
   2) Members (permission id 2), who do not have any special permissions
* All **Dreams** users are members by default, except for the very first user who signs up, who is an owner

A user's primary permissions are their global permissions. Then the channel permissions are layered on top. For example:
* An owner of **Dreams** has owner permissions in every channel they've joined
* A member of **Dreams** is a member in channels they are not owners of
* A member of **Dreams** is an owner in channels they are owners of

## 7. Due Dates and Weightings

|Iteration|Code and report due                  |Demonstration to tutor(s)      |Assessment weighting of project (%)|
|---------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|   1     |10am Monday 8th March (**week 4**)   |In YOUR **week 4** laboratory  |30%                                |
|   2     |10am Monday 5th April (**week 8**)   |In YOUR **week 8** laboratory  |40%                                |
|   3     |10am Monday 19th April (**week 10**)   |In YOUR **week 10** laboratory |30%                                |

### 7.1. Late Penalties

There is no late penalty, as we do not accept late submissions. You will be assessed on the most recent version of your work at the due date and time listed. We will automatically collect and submit the code that is on the `master` branch of your repository.

If the deadline is approaching and you have features that are either untested or failing their tests, **DO NOT MERGE IN THOSE MERGE REQUESTS**. Your tutor will look at unmerged branches and may allocate some reduced marks for incomplete functionality, but `master` should only contain working code.

### 7.2. Demonstration

For the demonstrations in weeks 4, 8, and 10, all team members **must** attend this lab session, or they will not receive a mark.

When you demonstrate this iteration in your lab time, it will consist of a 15 minute Q&A either in front of your tutor and some other students in your tutorial. For online classes, webcams are required to be on during this Q&A (your phone is a good alternative if your laptop/desktop doesn't have a webcam).

## 8. Other Expectations

While it is up to you as a team to decide how work is distributed between you, for the purpose of assessment there are certain key criteria all members must.

* Code contribution
* Documentation contribution
* Usage of git/GitLab
* Attendance
* Peer assessment
* Academic conduct

The details of each of these is below.

While, in general, all team members will receive the same mark (a sum of the marks for each iteration), **if you as an individual fail to meet these criteria your final project mark may be scaled down**, most likely quite significantly.

### 8.1. Project check-in

During your lab class, in weeks without project demonstrations, you and your team will conduct a short stand-up in the presence of your tutor. Each member of the team will briefly state what they have done in the past week, what they intend to do over the next week, and what issues they faced or are currently facing. This is so your tutor, who is acting as a representative of the client, is kept informed of your progress. They will make note of your presence and may ask you to elaborate on the work you've done.

Project check-ins are also excellent opportunities for your tutor to provide you with both technical and non-technical guidance.

### 8.2. Code contribution

All team members must contribute code to the project to a generally similar degree. Tutors will assess the degree to which you have contributed by looking at your **git history** and analysing lines of code, number of commits, timing of commits, etc. If you contribute significantly less code than your team members, your work will be closely examined to determine what scaling needs to be applied.

### 8.3. Documentation contribution

All team members must contribute documentation to the project to a generally similar degree. Tutors will assess the degree to which you have contributed by looking at your **git history** but also **asking questions** (essentially interviewing you) during your demonstration.

Note that, **contributing more documentation is not a substitute for not contributing code**.

### 8.4. Code Style and Documentation

You are required to ensure that your code:
 * Follows pythonic principles discussed in lectures and tutorials
 * Follows stylistic convenctions discussed in lectures and tutorials
 * (For iterations 2 & 3) your code should achieve a `10.00/10` `pylint` score

Examples of things to focus on include:
* Correct casing of variable, function and class names
* Meaningful variable and function names
* Readability of code and use of whitespace
* Modularisation and use of helper functions where needed

Your functions such as `auth_register`, `channel_invite`, `message_send`, etc. are also required to contain docstrings of the following format:

```
<Brief description of what the function does>

Arguments:
    <name> (<data type>)    - <description>
    <name> (<data type>)    - <description>
    ...

Exceptions:
    InputError  - Occurs when ...
    AccessError - Occurs when ...

Return Value:
    Returns <return value> on <condition>
    Returns <return value> on <condition>
```

In each iteration you will be assessed on ensuring that every relevant function/endpoint in the specification is appropriately documented.

### 8.5. Peer Assessment

There will be a mid-term peer assessment around Week 5 where you will rate each team member's contribution to the project up until that point and have the chance to raise concerns with any team members in writing.

You will be required to complete a form in week 10 where you rate each team member's contribution to the project and leave any comments you have about them. Information on how you can access this form will be released closer to Week 10.

Your other team members will **not** be able to see how you rated them or what comments you left in either peer assessment. If your team members give you a less than satisfactory rating, your contribution will be scrutinised and you may find your final mark scaled down.

### 8.6. Attendance

It is generally assumed that all team members will be present at the demonstrations and at weekly check-ins. If you're absent for more than 80% of the weekly check-ins or any of the demonstrations, your mark may be scaled down.

If, due to exceptional circumstances, you are unable to attend your lab for a demonstration, inform your tutor as soon as you can so they can record your absence as planned.

## 10. Plagiarism

The work you and your group submit must be your own work. Submission of work partially or completely derived from any other person or jointly written with any other person is not permitted. The penalties for such an offence may include negative marks, automatic failure of the course and possibly other academic discipline. Assignment submissions will be examined both automatically and manually for such submissions.

Relevant scholarship authorities will be informed if students holding scholarships are involved in an incident of plagiarism or other misconduct.

Do not provide or show your project work to any other person, except for your group and the teaching staff of COMP1531. If you knowingly provide or show your assignment work to another person for any reason, and work derived from it is submitted you may be penalized, even if the work was submitted without your knowledge or consent. This may apply even if your work is submitted by a third party unknown to you.

Note, you will not be penalized if your work has the potential to be taken without your consent or knowledge.
